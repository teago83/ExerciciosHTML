            This is a collection of very simple web pages made with HTML and CSS. Their creator
            is teago83, a big fan of the Monster Hunter franchise, having done all of this to 
            study some programming for web pages. This was all done for fun and it doesn't involve
            money in any sort of way. Monster Hunter is a gaming franchise fully owned by CAPCOM
            and teago83 is nothing more than a fan of theirs.
