                            Dual Blades (双剣 Souken), or 'DB' (previously known as Dual Swords or 'DS') 
                            are a type of weapon that are unable to block and have a very low ammount of 
                            damage per hit, but compensate with their increased mobility.
                            They are a very versatile weapon for dealing elemental or status damage,
                            due to their very high speed and number of hits per combo.

                            The Great Sword (大剣 Daiken) is a weapon capable of dealing massive damage 
                            with few charged attacks. One of the first weapons introduced in the
                            series, it's very popular and easy to learn. Aside from being able to deal
                            a lot of damage with few hits, the Great Sword can also use the blade itself
                            to block attacks, at the cost of the weapon's sharpness.

                            The Charge Blade is a weapon that can switch between two different modes: 
                            the Sword Mode and the Axe Mode. In Sword Mode, the user wields a sword and 
                            a large shield with a main goal of charging up energy. Once enough energy's 
                            been charged, it can be stored in the shield, and the hunter can use powerful 
                            explosive attacks in the slower but stronger Axe Mode.

                            introduced in Monster Hunter 2. Although it is very versatile 
                            and has a wide range of options, it is not the weapon of choice 
                            for an amateur but rather a weapon of choice for a skilled hunter.

                            Great Swords that resembled katanas. They became an
